# PRODIGY_ML_04

### Project Description

Developing robust behavior recognition models for better understanding of human-computer interaction and guided control. This project involves creating machine learning models capable of recognizing and classifying various movements using image or video data.

### Project Overview

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the LeapGestureRecog dataset from Kaggle to discover and understand different gestures and their variations.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform necessary preprocessing steps, such as resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the dataset, to prepare it for training the models.

3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning or deep learning methods for gesture recognition. Experiment with different architectures to find the most effective one.

4. **Model Training**: Train the selected model on the prepared data and optimize hyperparameters for improved performance.

5. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. **Visualization**: Visualize the model's predictions on sample images or video frames to understand its behavior.

7. **Deployment Considerations**: If necessary, consider deploying the model in a real-world application to ensure its effectiveness and accuracy in practical scenarios.
